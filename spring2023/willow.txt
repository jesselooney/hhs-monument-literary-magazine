Healed
Sophia Lee


Some call us beauty
	and some label us as the clutter
of the Autumn-kissed streets.
	Some paint us
and some paint on our bodies.
	Little ones jump on us
and older ones scrape us away into the shadows
	of the dry earth.


We hang on wooden thistles 
	and drink water and gold to live for you.
We change to look pretty
and rid our rich green with golden and amber for you. 
We fly with the wind 
	and exist for you.


But when we canâ€™t feel pretty 
	or live while you stand in awe
as we breathe our dying breath,
	we fall for you
down
	down
		down
			down.
We either look at the sky or the floor
	and we wish for the floor
for those who face the sky know what presses onto their stomachs
	and feel the utmost betrayal
because we died trying to look pretty for you. 
	And when we fall
you step on us 
and walk away.
