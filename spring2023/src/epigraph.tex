\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    All along the road the reddish\\
    purplish, forked, upstanding, twiggy\\
    stuff of bushes and small trees\\
    with dead, brown leaves under them\\
    leafless vines—\\>
    
    Lifeless in appearance, sluggish\\
    dazed spring approaches—\\>
    
    They enter the new world naked,\\
    cold, uncertain of all\\
    save that they enter. All about them\\
    the cold, familiar wind—\\>
    
    Now the grass, tomorrow\\
    the stiff curl of wildcarrot leaf\\
    One by one objects are defined—\\
    It quickens: clarity, outline of leaf\\>
    
    But now the stark dignity of\\
    entrance—Still, the profound change\\
    has come upon them: rooted, they\\
    grip down and begin to awaken\\>
